## BRING THE PERFORMANCE OF HAMMER STRENGTH HOME

Create a powerful, space-efficient training area. The half rack is constructed specifically for the home gym, but with the same commercial-grade steel and components that build the Hammer Strength racks used by the most demanding training facilities and athletes in the world. It bolts securely and quickly to wall studs, and once properly installed it allows you to take your strength training to a new level. With the Hammer Strength Home Squat Rack, serious exercisers can bring more than 30 years of strength training expertise into their home.
