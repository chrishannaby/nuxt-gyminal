## BRING THE PERFORMANCE OF HAMMER STRENGTH HOME

The Hammer Strength Adjustable Bench is the ideal home weight bench for the lifter that needs variety and stability in their strength training routines. With 7 different back pad positions—starting at -10 degrees for decline lifts and inclining to 75 degrees for military press and multiple angles in between—this bench is a centerpiece for elite training in the gym or at home. The high-quality frame is designed to handle the demands of the strongest lifters, and the injection-molded pads provide the durability, quality and support athletes need to focus on performing lifts. The bench’s lightweight design paired with rubber wheels and a conveniently placed handle makes it easy to move around your home gym.
